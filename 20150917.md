[Lessons from the Cloud Bunker](https://www.subbu.org/blog/2015/08/lessons-from-the-cloud-bunker)

Lots of interesting points here. I’m not disagreeing with the thrust of the post, but perhaps a few details are worth some discussion.

--------------------------------------------

*“Don’t bet on ephemeral cloud abstractions. Ephemeral abstractions are things that fail. 
These may not recover from failures.”*

--------------------------------------------

Besides the out and out failure case, other abnormal cases need to be considered. Resources, including ephemeral resources, can also degrade, perhaps slowly, and become essentially unproductive or have jitter states. with uneven response. The higher level monitoring process, if there is one, must look not for just the step function of state change from working to not working, but also other states that break set boundary conditions as well. 

And it’s not just ephemeral resources that need to be considered, since durable resources might fail or be degraded either at the service endpoint or in reachability.  

But to address the main point, reasonable people bet on ephemeral cloud components all the time. Consider the case of using AWS spot instances, generally after evaluating risk and things like spot price history. Launching a spot instance request is just a bet that the associated workload will complete before the spot price market changes and kills the instance.

--------------------------------------------------------

*“the amount of engineering it takes to implement \[putting together a closed-loop automation layer using infrastructure automation, exposing APIs as well as implementing metrics, monitoring, and orchestration to make their apps resilient to infrastructure failures\] is non-trivial. Very few get it right.”*

--------------------------------------------------------  

Even if the infrastructure team puts all this effort into remediation automation, it’s not clear how this would make a business app running on top of the infrastructure resilient to component failure. 

Automation of PMDR might bring the resources needed to support the app back online. 
Some platforms make this easier. For example, if you’re using AWS, you can use Cloudwatch to sense then stop, terminate, reboot, or recover. Pacemaker offers something similar for Openstack and Linux more generally. So there are tools that allow the automation of the Provision, Deploy, Monitor, Remediate cycle.

But even if the PMDR cycle is automated, this doesn’t address business application resilience, which is the key issue. What happens to transactions in flight that are yet to be committed to persistent storage? What if the resource assigned to host the persistent storage itself becomes degraded or temporarily unresponsive or outright fails? 
Even if instances of the underlying infrastructure fails, then are recovered, how does the application handle past activity up to the last recovery point?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*"I would describe a cloud native abstraction as one with two fundamental characteristics:*
- *Durable: The abstraction may be built using ephemeral parts, 
but the abstraction itself is durable in the sense that it survives failure of its parts.*
- *Declarative: The user of the abstraction declares the desired state, 
and the service providing that abstraction attempts to maintain the abstraction in that desired state."*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’d draw a distinction between “durable,” as I understand it here, and “resilient.” 
Durability is a resource’s resistance to unplanned change, though the service itself may be unreachable. For instance, Amazon storage has higher durability guarantees than reachability guarantees.

Service resilience, in contrast, means that a business application can continue to receive service from required necessary and sufficient components even if some of the total inventory of components providing service fail or are degraded. I’d suggest that resilience is meant here.

Even with durable or resilient cloud native abstractions, wouldn’t the application that’s dependent on the underlying infrastructure still need to be designed to be resilient on its own? As a business application designer, wouldn’t I design my application so that, if the cloud native abstraction failed or degraded, my application would still provide service? After all, everything fails, including durable, resilient infrastructure.

And, if the app is ported to a different environment with possible lesser service guarantees, possibly at a disaster recovery site, you’d still want the app to provide its own service resilience. Legacy applications with design not suited to IaaS failure would, of course, be helped by a more resilient infrastructure.

Should cloud infrastructure be designed to be resilient? Yes. Is that going to be enough to make the business applications at the higher layer resilient, probably not.
