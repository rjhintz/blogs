[The Cloudcast #216 - The Evolution of Cloud Operations](http://www.thecloudcast.net/2015/10/the-cloudcast-216-evolution-of-cloud.html)

Another interesting show with, as usual, an informed guest. 

Around 4:15 the interview touched on Mr Imbriaco’s time at Digital Ocean and issues of managing scale during rapid growth. There’s only so much you can cover in 30 minutes, but it would have been great to hear more of any detail that could be disclosed such as:
* white box versus branded components
* datacenter network topology (spine/leaf? number of tiers?)
* datacenter geodiversity and database replication
* [a zillion similar nerd-out questions]. 

Around 14:35 the questions of “what changes should I make?”, “when do I start to make changes?”, and “where does this discussion take place?” came up. This general area is really worth exploring for the enterprise.

Who’s supposed to be thinking about these things in the enterprise, proposing solutions, and making the decisions? Yes, developers, operations staff, networking, security as well as compliance and audit all have roles to play in understanding the business needs; available and emerging technology; legacy technical debt; what the competition is doing; and financial implications, but, as Mr Imbriaco says, the conversations aren’t happening.

Presumably CIOs have the decision making role, but how often do we hear of a CIO actually talking about these issues as opposed to some 50K foot “vision statement” that would have been appropriate 5, 10, or 20 years ago? And probably using the same words. No wonder enterprises are bogged down in technical debt and finding it difficult to get started or even define what “get started” means.

Around 17:50 the role of monolithic apps versus microservices was touched on. I would have liked to hear more on the appropriate place of the monolithic app architecture. Everything doesn’t have to be microservices, but it’s just a fact that most of current enterprise technical debt is wrapped up in monolithic apps that grew over time and there's rarely a planned, funded effort made to decompose them as they matured. These hard to maintain apps, not all of which are impenetrable ERP bloatware, also lead directly to the hated (by central IT) departmental shadow systems.

Around 29:10 there was some discussion about the role of Go versus Java and does it matter. It would have been interesting to discuss this further in the context of scale-out ready (or, barf, cloud native) apps. What matters for scale out apps? How do they play with legacy apps that may read/write the same persistent data? What principles of distributed computing do we have to know to get decent resilience when component failure is guaranteed? 

Yes, the language choice is probably irrelevant, but what technology choices are relevant? There was some discussion, but I’d would have liked to hear even more drill down, especially about architecture, which was touched on briefly. I probably don’t agree that architecture that people are comfortable with is good enough today, for instance. 

Around 32:50 there was discussion of the importance of human collaboration. Agreed. As suggested earlier the discussion is revolving around Dev and Ops (maybe including Networking). How often do we hear that the Storage and Security silos are involved? Their cultures are generally even more isolated than Dev and Ops.

All in all, another useful show. Thanks for this helpful content.
