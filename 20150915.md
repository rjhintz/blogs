Comment on [Modern Enterprise Podcast: Episode 1 – Services as a Platform by James Urquhart](http://allthingsplatforms.com/podcast/modern-enterprise-podcast-episode-1-services-as-a-platform-by-james-urquhart/)

Interesting interview with a great, informed guest.

Just to reprise one or two of the comments I made over on the Soundcloud site. Around 11:30 there’s a comment that people don’t want the biggest hurdle getting to the point of solving the problem, but rather just solving the problem.

One barrier issue is that there’s typically so much tech debt that composing services from an IaaS is tough because software distros have to be converged, version control needs to be reexamined and likely ported to something modern, the cadence of development through deployment needs to be reengineered, disaster recovery/business continuity needs to be redesigned, budgets need to refocus from capex to opex, and so on. So getting to the point of solving the problem while trying to keep the apps running, applying maintenance, and including enhancements is a real challenge.

Around 20:00 there’s an observation that the new PaaS is something like the Github-Jenkins-Maven++ chain. One question that’s fun to ask, and usually gets embarrassed responses, is how often do you deploy to production? Yeah, Facebook deploys 100000s times/day, but the enterprise standard isn’t that. Once again a lot of internal IT processes need to be reengineered so the combining and recombining of services James talks about can be realized.

Not disagreeing with what’s being said, just saying that the typical enterprise is mired in technical debt, which crowds out the ability to innovate. This is especially noticeable in government and education where there are fewer competitive pressures. Yes, they are notable success stories, but they aren’t the typical site.
