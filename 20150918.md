[Cloudcast 213 - What is Immutable Infrastructure?](http://www.thecloudcast.net/2015/09/the-cloudcast-213-what-is-immutable.html)

I made some earlier comments over on the guest’s “[Lessons from the Cloud Bunker](https://www.subbu.org/blog/2015/08/lessons-from-the-cloud-bunker)” blog post, so these are more associated with the podcast discussion. Great podcast subject with another informed guest.

Around 6:15 there’s a discussion of “immutable.” Yes, it means unchanging and has the consequence of allowing the immutable component to be disposed of, but it’s not entirely clear from the discussion what the benefit is and how the benefit is realized.

The point of creating, using, and ultimately disposing of immutable components is to get away from the entropy that accumulates in components that are patched and repatched, have a configuration change outside of policy, have an undocumented “temporary” change that becomes permanent (and stays undocumented), and the 1000 other quick and dirty changes that are endemic to most shops.

Conceptually, if a component is created as immutable, that component can easily replace a failing component or a component taken out of service for other reasons, such as reaching the end of its life cycle. 

Usually the immutable component is created using automation policy, so it’s easy to configure one or a thousand instances and each instance benefits as well from the latest fixes and enhancements. The configuration policy specifically creates the new component to be compatible with the old for function, allowing easy drop in (ha ha, that’s the concept). Obviously having the config policy applied by automation facilitates Don’t Repeat Yourself. 

Later, when the replacement component itself fails or is taken out of service, it can be replaced by another immutable, compatible component, again using the latest versioning.

The big benefit comes when the old component can be taken out of service without disrupting the service provided by the higher level business application. That means the business application has to be architected by developers to provide service resiliency when a component fails or is removed during maintenance. That is, the component has an “ephemeral” character and is easily disposable. It’s not so much the disposability that’s important, though, as the one for one, non disruptive replaceability.

The newly added, possibly ephemeral, replacement component is put into service, service discovery notes its addition, and the component is added to the fleet of compute, storage, networking components for providing resources for the high level business application.

The component addition and deployment might follow declarative specifications of the desired infrastructure state. Depending on latency of monitoring and reaction of management process, the infrastructure for supporting the business application can be durable to a specific service level so that the app can provide non-disruptive service. Of course, this depends on there being sufficient components in an operational state to provide service according to usually separately declared application performance requirements.

Around 23:30 in the podcast there’s a discussion of how to start. Great topic. Here I’m going to depart somewhat from the experience mentioned by Mr Allamaraju. While eBay might be able because of its expertise to jump right to expose and consume APIs, that’s likely beyond the capabilities of most shops. I’d say that most shops could get the greatest benefit by identifying and mitigating technical debt and that should be added to the work queue instead of being ignored or pretending it doesn’t exist, as is usual.
