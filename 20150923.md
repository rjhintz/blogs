[A Brief Look at Immutable Infrastructure and Why it is Such a Quest by Adron Hall](http://thenewstack.io/a-brief-look-at-immutable-infrastructure-and-why-it-is-such-a-quest/)

A couple of comments on this interesting post:

------------------------------

*Adron Hall: Immutable simply means something that is created and left unchanged. Immutable things are understood as is, without need to mutate them, and by that have no need to be mutable.*

------------------------------

Another way to look at immutable is as “not changeable,” either by policy, as we are discussing here, or in principle, such as a constant, like “2.” For the “immutable infrastructure” type, it’s only by policy that an infrastructure artifact is immutable. 

As an example, you could violate policy and change an “immutable” compute instance simply by logging into it and making a configuration change, documented or not. You might do this to correct an error, or adjust a value, or for a zillion other reasons. 

If the config was in error, there’s an obvious need for a change. You can change the running instance, as is typically done today, or you can kill it and replace it with a newly generated, corrected instance. In each case,  the replacement is presumably without disrupting the higher level service the computing instance supports.

------------------------------

*Adron Hall: And thanks to OS-level virtualization, which is spearheading the movement for immutable infrastructure, these images are extremely fast to deploy.*

------------------------------

The replacement image may or may not be fast to deploy. It’s common, for instance, to rebuild the replacement image from a minimal, bare system using some tool like Chef or Puppet. It might takes 15 minutes to deploy. There are generally one or more dependencies on remote repositories. If the remote repo is slow to respond or doesn’t respond at all, you might be waiting a long time for the replacement to deploy. 

An alternative is to bake a golden image and deploy it. Obviously this can take a lot less time.

------------------------------

*Adron Hall: In some scenarios performance on an individual instance is slower than a dedicated box, but it makes efforts to scale-out horizontally dramatically easier, providing another way to build out faster environments, not just from a faster deployment, but actually adding more machines to make processing faster.*

------------------------------

I’m not clear about some of this. First, an individual instance or a dedicated box should perform the same if it’s generated as immutable or not. And scale out isn’t especially helped by immutable instances. You can generate a 1,000 immutable or changeable instances in the same time. 

------------------------------

*Adron Hall: If a patch or update is needed, the server image is updated and a full redeployment of everything is made from an immutable context. No servers in production are patched or manipulated in a mutable way.*

------------------------------

The “immutable context” here is just the end result after the recipe for the resource is applied. To be clear, the recipe itself is necessarily mutable, then, after it’s tested and finalized, it can generate the immutable image. 

And while production resources are an important category of immutable infra, there’s no need to limit the scope to just production. In fact, you’d often want immutable resources in QA mirroring what’s in production. Development can use the same resources, too. This deals with the “It worked on my laptop” issue. This is suggested later on the piece in the CI/CD section.

Not really discussed here is that there’s an issue for those resources that carry state, such as databases or logging. The entry to the rabbit hole starts by searching on “distributed database” or “distributed logging.”
